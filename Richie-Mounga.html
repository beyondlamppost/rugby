<p><b>OPINION: </b>There's a place for Richie Mo'unga in the All Blacks' 10 jersey, and Nelson is that place.

<p>After an error-ridden first half last week in Sydney, it seemed that Beauden Barrett was feeling the pressure from growing calls for Crusaders' first-five, Richie Mo'unga, to be given his starting spot in the All Blacks' fifteen. Indeed, that argument would have received a lot of air time in living rooms around New Zealand as the teams headed into the changing rooms, with Australia leading the world champions 6-5 at the break.

<p>Barrett had missed every attempt at goal, and even failed to find the touch line from a penalty early on - a task that many would reasonably argue is fairly fundamental for the All Blacks kicker.

<p>Coming back out of the sheds though, the 66,000-strong crowd at ANZ Stadium saw glimpses of the brilliance that has made the 27-year-old a two-time World Rugby player of the year.

<p>In a near-perfect performance on Saturday night at Eden Park, Barrett was undoubtedly back in form, scoring 30 points in the All Blacks' 40-12 victory over the Australians to retain the Bledisloe Cup for the sixteenth year running. His four tries were a record for a New Zealander playing against Australia, and a fifth try was disallowed following a TMO intervention for a knock on.

<p>No one could dispute that the man has earned a place in the team.

<p>In the weeks following the Crusaders' win over the Lions, which saw them retain the 2018 Super Rugby championship, All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen, stood firm in the face of pressure to give the Cantabrian Mo'unga a run on in the 10 spot. Despite a stand out season for the franchise, Hansen minimised Mo'unga's success, claiming that he had "play[ed] the way we're expecting him to play behind a pack like that", referencing the Crusaders' forward pack, which contained seven All Blacks.

<p>It's safe to say that Hansen will feel comfortable in his decision to exclude Mo'unga in favour of Barrett at this point in the season, but having saved face and proved his point, he now has nothing to lose by giving the popular Crusader a chance to gain experience in the black jersey.

<p>Mo'unga is a solid, reliable player, whose ability to successfully guide his team around the park has made him a stand out player at every level of the game to date. More traditional than Barrett, Mo'unga is an Andrew Mehrtens to Barrett's Carlos Spencer. He's calm under pressure, makes sound decisions, and routinely makes the job look easy. He would also provide depth in the first five position, which is currently lacking following Lima Sopoaga's departure for England at the end of the Highlanders' Super Rugby campaign in July.

<p>We all know that there's a World Cup approaching, and injuries have a habit of highlighting gaps in depth during World Cup years. With just under 13 months until the competition for the Webb Ellis Cup begins, there is no excuse for leaving a player of Mo'unga's calibre without game time and the experience of test match pressure.

<p>In a team that's increasingly able to shuffle positions with minimal impact on their performance, selecting Mo'unga doesn't have to mean that Barrett is left out entirely. He has fantastic impact off the bench, and the ability to move to the outside backs as required. If Hansen has some aversion to resting Barrett (and there's no reason that he should), there are plenty of options to include him.

<p>But when the All Blacks face the Pumas at Trafalgar Park on 8 September, Barrett should not be their first five-eighth.

<p>That jersey belongs to Richie Mo'unga.
